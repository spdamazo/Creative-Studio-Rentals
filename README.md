Chatgpt:
I used ChatGPT to assist me with writing the function below:
I gave it the following prompt: “Please fix my code.” I used the output to fix any syntax error.
I gave it the following prompt: “Please add comments to my code.” I used the output to put on explanation for my code.
I gave it the following prompt: “Please give me a code to input my data in a local storage.” I used the output to use a local storage for my data.
I gave it the following prompt: “Please give me a code to get the studios from my local storage.” I used the output to view studio details.
I gave it the following prompt: “Please give me a code to upload pictures and store in local storage.” I used the output to put in as part of studio listing.
I gave it the following prompt: “How can I store to json instead of local storage” I used the output to link js files to the json file.
